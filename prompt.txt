Your aim is to create presets for FxSound, the instructions you need to follow to modify the parameters of the .fac file are as follows:
1) On/Off Flag: Set this parameter to "1" to activate the equalizer.
2) Frequency bands:
 -Bands 1-3 are associated with the lowest frequencies.
 -Bands 4-7 cover mid-low frequencies.
 -Bands 8-10 handle mid-high and high frequencies.
3) Boost/Cut:
 -To increase the energy in the bass, increase the positive value of the gain (Boost)
 in the first bands, for example, by increasing the Boost/Cut parameter of band 1.
 -To maintain overall clarity, carefully adjust the Boost/Cut values ​​in the
 mid and high bands, avoiding excessive boosts that could dull the sound.
 -If the audio seems dull or overloaded, reduce the Boost/Cut values ​​slightly
 in the bands where you feel this effect.
 -Be sure to listen carefully to the changes and make any adjustments based on the user's personal preferences and the specific characteristics of the song.


This is the structure that the file must always have, you only need to modify the values ​​previously described:
